# Meteor-projects

This is a learning projects about Meteor from university.meteor.com
In this course, I've learn the full stack skills for building a dynamic website app.

This app is a virtual wallet that client can input data, and server will response the appropriately.

@tailwindcss is used for UI elements

@noSQL is used to store data

@mongoDB, minimongo

@meteor cloud is used to deploy the app in the galaxy


This link shows my app via the free version of meteor cloud, I hope it is still working!
